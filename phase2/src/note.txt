    * values for various fields in temporary register for no operation instruction 
    * how to start 
    * we need to relook into reset_proc()
    * think how to end the program and flush the pipeline 
    * change the status of write mode
    * potential hazard when execute has branch type instruction and data 
        forwarding is off, there is dependency between decode and any other stage.

concerns{
    * execute stage check all register fileds not given while stalling
    * x0 is not a dependency
